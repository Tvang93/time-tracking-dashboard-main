Review:
"Site looks great and matches the Figma; responsiveness works and functions; from height of 890px and lower, the #exercisePrevious text could use a bit of padding on the bottom as the text begins to get a bit squished; on a screen width between 880-768px, when 'Monthly' is selected, the #exerciseCurrent text in the 'Work' card causes the box to overflow. I would suggest to make the h1 font-size a bit smaller in that general range; on sm/mobile dimensions, I would suggest setting the #exercisePrevious text to 'text-align: end' just to ensure that it stays to its end of the card in smaller resolutions; besides that, everything else is good"


-- made the font-size adjustment for tablet view as recommended, it also fixed the issue with work box overflowing. added text-align: end. worked on height issues a bit, still working on it
